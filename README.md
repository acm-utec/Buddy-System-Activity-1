## The Challenge

From **July 6th** until **August 23rd**, 2020, all the members of the organization will be split into pairs, with the challenge of creating a sample class on a topic of their liking. The main goal of this event is to **promote research and the creation of intellectual material** between the members of our community.

The **top 3 classes**, as selected by a jury, will be presented as part of an external event of the Universidad de Ingeniería y Tecnología - UTEC.

## Guidelines

To check out who is your assigned pair for this activity, as well as some useful details about the challenge, be sure to check the <a href="https://github.com/acm-utec/Buddy-System-Activity-1/blob/master/guidelines.pdf">guidelines</a> provided by the organization.

**Note:** Be sure to download the PDF as it contains some useful links that will be relevant during the extension of the event. 

## Getting Started

If you and your teammate have already read the guidelines and are ready to begin working, here's the process to create your branch:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/acm-utec/Buddy-System-Activity-1.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Buddy-System-Activity-1

# Create your team's branch
$ git checkout -b name_of_your_team

# Set the upstream of your branch so it is visible on the repository
$ git push -u origin name_of_your_team

# Create the team's folder inside of your branch (you shall work there)
$ mkdir name_of_your_team
```

You can also do this process on the repository page if you find it more efficient.
